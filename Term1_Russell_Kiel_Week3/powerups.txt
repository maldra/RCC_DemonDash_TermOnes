TermLab Assignment : PowerUps

Shield: Unlike most games where the shield surrounds the player and protect them from
	all elements in the game. This shield will only protect you from the flying enemies	
	The player will still have to jump over obstacle to avoid being killed.

Double Bullet: Witht this powerup im thinking two ways;first the dragon shoots out 2 bullets
		at a time inflicting double the damage or he shoots one bullet but twice as fast
		either way double the damage is inflicted.

Transform: THis powerup basically replaces the dragon on screen with one 3x and big and shoots
	   a constant flame across the screen for 15 seconds.
